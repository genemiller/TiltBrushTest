# TiltBrush

Unity Project containing three of Darcy Gerbarg’s artworks for the AR Installation Alpha Test.
- Initial release 6/15/2021
- Gene Miller

The artworks are named:
1.	Violet Brush (animated framed painting)
2.	Party (animated framed painting)
3.	TL15_11 (3D Painting)

## Assumptions and questions

- Assumption 1. Darcy Gerbarg and the Alpha Test team will decide locations, orientations, and scales for each of the three artworks.
  - Each artwork is currently prepared with bottoms near ground level, and tops about double the height of a person (e.g. 3 to 4 meters)

- Assumption 2. The Alpha Test team will be using a Game Engine (such as Unity3D.)
  - NOTE: The models are currently packaged as a Unity3D Project – Version  2019.4.
  - Does Alpha Test team prefer a different Game Engine? (e.g. Unreal)

- Assumption 3. The Alpha Test team will be using an AR SDK (such as Google ARCore)
  - NOTE: An AR SDK has NOT yet been integrated with the Unity3D Project 
  - Does the Alpha Test team plan to integrate the AR SDK?
  - Or should Gene Miller integrate the AR SDK? (which one?)

## Operational Steps (based on Assumptions listed above)
1. Download this GitHub repository (https://github.com/genemiller/AR-AlphaTest)

2.  Open the Unity Project AR-AlphaTest (Note: this Project was tested with Unity Version 2019.4.2f1)

3. Integrate with AR toolkit (E.g. Google AR-Core)

4. For each of the three scenes:
        1. VioletBrush
        2. Party
        3. TL15
   1. Load the scene
   2. Unload the other two scenes
   3. Build for target platform(s) (e.g. Android)
   4. Deploy the build file(s) (e.g., APK) to target platform (e.g. Android)

5. Review the results (consult with Gene Miller if there are bugs)

6. Provide build files (or AR Package integration) to Darcy Gerbarg and Gene Miller (who will also review the results)

8. Discuss possible changes, e.g.,
   - Scale, height, orientation
   - Timing and degree of animation
   - Whether colors and shading look right
